Welcome to the secure OpenVPN installer (github.com/wmtech-1/OpenVPN-Installer)

I need to ask you a few questions before starting the setup
You can leave the default options and just press enter if you are ok with them

I need to know the IPv4 address of the network interface you want OpenVPN listening to.
If your server is running behind a NAT, (e.g. LowEndSpirit, Scaleway) leave the IP address as it is. (local/private IP)
Otherwise, it should be your public IPv4 address.
IP address: your-domain.feste-ip.net

What port do you want for OpenVPN?
   1) Default: 1194
   2) Custom
   3) Random [49152-65535]
Port choice [1-3]: 1

Enable IPv6? (ensure that your machine has IPv6 support):
   1) Yes (default)
   2) No
Enable IPv6 [1-2]: 1

What protocol do you want for OpenVPN?
Unless UDP is blocked, you should not use TCP (unnecessarily slower)
Protocol [UDP/TCP]: TCP

What DNS do you want to use with the VPN?
   1) Current system resolvers (from /etc/resolv.conf)
   2) Cloudflare (Anycast: worldwide)
   3) Quad9 (Anycast: worldwide)
   4) FDN (France)
   5) DNS.WATCH (Germany)
   6) OpenDNS (Anycast: worldwide)
   7) Google (Anycast: worldwide)
   8) Yandex Basic (Russia)
   9) AdGuard DNS (Russia)
DNS [1-9]: 1

See https://github.com/wmtech-1/OpenVPN-Installer#encryption to learn more about 
the encryption in OpenVPN and the choices I made in this script.
Please note that all the choices proposed are secure (to a different degree)
and are still viable to date, unlike some default OpenVPN options

Choose which cipher you want to use for the data channel:
   1) AES-128-CBC (fastest and sufficiently secure for everyone, recommended)
   2) AES-192-CBC
   3) AES-256-CBC
Alternatives to AES, use them only if you know what you're doing.
They are relatively slower but as secure as AES.
   4) CAMELLIA-128-CBC
   5) CAMELLIA-192-CBC
   6) CAMELLIA-256-CBC
   7) SEED-CBC
Cipher [1-7]: 1

Choose what size of Diffie-Hellman key you want to use:
   1) 2048 bits (fastest)
   2) 3072 bits (recommended, best compromise)
   3) 4096 bits (most secure)
DH key size [1-3]: 1

Choose what size of RSA key you want to use:
   1) 2048 bits (fastest)
   2) 3072 bits (recommended, best compromise)
   3) 4096 bits (most secure)
RSA key size [1-3]: 1

Do you want to protect the configuration file with a password?
(e.g. encrypt the private key with a password)
   1) Add a passwordless client
   2) Use a password for the client
Select an option [1-2]: 1

Finally, tell me a name for the client certificate and configuration
Use one word only, no special characters
Client name: clientTCP
